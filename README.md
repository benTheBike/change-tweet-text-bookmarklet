# change-tweet-text-bookmarklet
A bookmarklet that changes the text of each tweet on Twitter.

## How to use
In your browser, create a new bookmarket. Call it whatever you want. For it's URL/location/whatever, copy & paste the contents of ```[bookmarklet.js]```(https://github.com/benTheBike/change-tweet-text-bookmarklet/blob/master/bookmarklet.js) in it.

Then change ```TEXT``` to whatever you want each tweet to say.

## Code
Its pretty simple, you can see an un-minified version [here](https://github.com/benTheBike/change-tweet-text-bookmarklet/blob/master/readable.js). 

## Disclaimer
I am not associated with Twitter. This will only work as long as each tweet on Twitter has the class ```tweet-text```.
